Starting from 3.0, Reactor is now organized into multiple projects:

# Reactor Core
[![Reactor Core](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.projectreactor/reactor-core/badge.svg?style=plastic)](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.projectreactor/reactor-core)

Reactive foundations for apps and frameworks and reactive extensions inspired API with [Mono](http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html) (1 element) and [Flux](http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html) (n elements) types

# Reactive Streams Commons
In a continuous mission to design the most efficient concurrency operators for Reactive Streams, a common effort -codename [Reactive Streams Commons](https://github.com/reactor/reactive-streams-commons)- has begun. Reactor is fully aligned with _RSC_ design and is directly inlining _RSC_ within its stable API contract scoped under reactor-core. Reactive Streams Commons is a research effort shared with everyone and is demanding of efficient stream processing challengers, therefore it is naturally decoupled of any framework noise.

### Enrolling

[Join the initiative](https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup), fork, discuss and PR anytime. Roadmap is collaborative and we do enjoy new ideas, simplifications, doc, feedback, and, did we mention feedback already ;) ? As any other open source project, you are the hero, Reactor is only useful because of you and we can't wait to see your pull request mate !

### Maven Artifacts

Fresh snapshot and release artifacts are provided in the _repo.spring.io_ repositories. 
Stable Release are synchronozied with Maven Central. To add this repo to your Gradle build, specify the URL like the following:

```groovy

    repositories {
      //maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/libs-release' }
      //maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone' }
      maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot' }
      mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
      // Reactor Core
      compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.0.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT"

      // Reactor Aeron
      // compile "io.projectreactor.ipc:reactor-aeron:0.6.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT"

       // Reactor Netty4
       // compile "io.projectreactor.ipc:reactor-netty:0.6.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT"

    }
```
