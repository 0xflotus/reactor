.Head first with a Groovy example of some Core work
[source,groovy]
----
//Initialize context and get default dispatcher
Environment.initialize()

//RingBufferDispatcher with 8192 slots by default
def dispatcher = Environment.sharedDispatcher()

//Create a callback
Consumer<Integer> c = { data ->
        println "some data arrived: $data"
}

//Create an error callback
Consumer<Throwable> errorHandler = { it.printStackTrace }

//Dispatch data asynchronously
r.dispatch(1234, c, errorHandler)

Environment.terminate()
