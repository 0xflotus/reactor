.Head first with a Groovy example of some Core work
[source,groovy]

//Initialize context and get default dispatcher
Environment.initialize()

//RingBufferDispatcher with 8192 slots by default
def dispatcher = Environment.sharedDispatcher()

//Create a callback
Consumer<Integer> c = { data ->
        println "some data arrived: $data"
}

//Create an error callback
Consumer<Throwable> errorHandler = { it.printStackTrace }

//Dispatch data asynchronously
r.dispatch(1234, c, errorHandler)

== Core Overview

.How Doge can use Reactor-Core
image::images/core-overview.png[Core Overview, width=500]

*Reactor Core* has the following artefacts:

****
* *Common IO & functional types*, some directly backported from Java 8 Functional Interfaces
** Function, Supplier, Consumer, Predicate, BiConsumer, BiFunction
** Tuples
** Resource, Pausable, Timer
** Buffer, Codec and a handful of predifined Codecs
* *Environment* context
* *Dispatcher* contract and a handful of predefined Dispatchers
* Predefined *Reactive Streams Processor*
****


Alone, reactor-core can already be used as a drop-in replacement for another Message-Passing strategy, to schedule timed tasks or to organize your code in small functional blocks implementing the Java 8 backport interfaces.
Such breakdown allows to play more nicely with other Reactive libraries especially removing the burden of understanding the RingBuffer for the impatient developer.

[[core-functional]]
== Functional Artefacts
Functional reusable blocks are core and mostly a required artefact to use as soon as you get into Reactor. footnoteref:[disclaimer,Unless you only want to use the Core Processor which are mostly standalone at this stage. We also plan to align Dispatcher with Core Processors overtime.]



[[core-dispatchers]]
== Environment and Dispatchers
Using Environment and Dispatchers to compute or schedule (a)synchronous tasks.

[[core-codecs]]
== Codecs and Buffer
Working with Codecs and Buffer to marshall/unmarshall bytes efficiently.
